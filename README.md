## Best Practices for Code Quality

### Error Handling
- Implement try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.
- - Log errors with sufficient detail to troubleshoot effectively.
  - - Use custom error messages where applicable to enhance clarity.
   
    - ### Readability
    - - Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables).
      - - Use comments to describe complex logic and functions.
        - - Organize code into modules or classes for better structure.
         
          - ### Performance
          - - Optimize algorithms for efficiency where possible.
            - - Minimize DOM manipulation to improve rendering speed.
              - - Use asynchronous operations to keep the UI responsive.
               
                - ## Testing
                - - Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
                  - - Use integration tests to ensure modules work together as expected.
                    - - Automate regression testing to catch issues early in the development cycle.
